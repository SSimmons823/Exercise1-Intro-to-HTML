<P> Hello, My name is Shameika Simmons. I was born in Savannah, GA and raised as a military brat traveling all over with my family.
    I have lived in TX, Germany, Korea, CO, AL, VA, SC, and served a tour in Afghanistan. I love to travel and educate myself on technology.
    I just finished 10 years of serving in The Army as of December 2018. since leaving the military and becoming a Veteran, I have been
    working in the Aerospace Industry as an Interior Technician.I just recently relocated to Goodyear, AZ on a job contract. I love my job and the pay is great but my true passion is 
    learning about computers, technology, and coding. I hope that this class is the start of my new career. I'm a fast learner
    when it comes to computers so I hope that I can keep up. This is an amazing opportunity and I plan to take full advantage of it.
</P>
